Slides for a talk given to Glasgow.pm (a mostly git-using audience) on
11/11/2010. The idea was to

 - explain a little bit of what git's doing under the hood
 - explain how the darcs model differs
 - cut through some of the tangle of conflicting terminology
 - explain why git users think branching's such a big deal, and why darcs users
   think that cherry-picking's such a big deal
   (spoilers: the answers are the same!).

Thanks very much to Eric Kow and Guillaume Hoffman for answering my questions
about darcs. Any errors remaining are of course my own.

To build the TeX source you'll need the prosper, xy and graphicsx packages
installed.
